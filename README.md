# Javascript-Clock

## Challenges I Faced?

I had difficulty understanding how to put the underlying logic of a clock into JavaScript.

## How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

Before I wrote a line of code I wrote out what I wanted to happen step-by-step on a whiteboard. Once I had a general idea of how the program should work I began to take the logic that I wrote out in common english and translated into JavaScript bit by bit. By leveraging platforms like Google, YouTube, MDN docs, Stackoverflow, GitHub, online courses, and reference guides I was able to find the proper JavaScript methods and functions needed to complete the task and I programmed the clock accordingly.

## What Did I Learn? 

* Gained a deeper understanding of the DOM 
* Received more practice with JavaScript syntax
* Obtained more practice with CSS & HTML
* Secured a deeper understanding of thinking programmatically
