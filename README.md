# Javascript-Clock

## Challenges I Faced?

I had difficulty understanding how to put the underlying logic of a calculator into JavaScript.

## How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

Before I wrote a line of code I wrote out what I wanted to happen step-by-step on a whiteboard. Once I had a general idea of how the program should work I began to take the logic that I wrote out in common english and translated into JavaScript bit by bit. By leveraging platforms like Google, YouTube, MDN docs, Stackoverflow, GitHub, online courses, and reference guides I was able to find the proper JavaScript methods and functions needed to complete the task and I programmed the calculator accordingly.

## What Did I Learn? 

Have a more solid understanding of the DOM and general JavaScript syntax
